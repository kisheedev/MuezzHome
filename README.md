sudo apt update
sudo apt install chromium-browser chromium-chromedriver
```
### Set Up as a Cronjob

To run the script at startup on your Raspberry Pi, set it up as a cronjob:

1. Open the crontab file for the current user:
```bash
crontab -e
```
2. Add the following line at the end of the crontab file to run the script at startup (Make sure to replace /home/pi/MuezzHome/ with the correct path to your script.py script):
```bash
@reboot /usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/MuezzHome/script.py 
```
3. Save and exit the editor.

### Verify the Cronjob

To verify that the cronjob has been added correctly, you can list the cron jobs with the following command:
```bash
crontab -l
```
You should see the line you added to run the script at startup.
